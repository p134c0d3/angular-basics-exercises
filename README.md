# Angular Basics

I learned a lot about binding data, both one way, and two way databinding, and it's usefulness in dynamically updating and changing the DOM on our application. 
- Using ngFor to loop through an array and create additional elements for the items in those arrays.
- Using ngClass and ngStyle to change how the elements in the DOM look based on certain criteria.
- Using ngModel to dynamically update the DOM as input is entered or events are triggered.
- using ngIf to dynamically hide or display elements on the DOM if certain values are returned true or false.
